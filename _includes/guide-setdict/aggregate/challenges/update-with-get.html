<p>
  We have frequently used the idiom:
</p>
<pre>
if key in data:
    data[key] = data[key] + 1
else:
    data[key] = 1
</pre>
<p>
  to either update the value associated with a key,
  or insert a value if the key isn't present.
  We can rewrite this as:
</p>
<pre>
if key not in data:
    data[key] = 0
data[key] += 1
</pre>
<p>
  but it's even better to use:
</p>
<pre>
data[key] = data.get(key, 0) + 1
</pre>
<p>
  Rewrite the examples in this lesson to use this idiom,
  and explain why we <em>can't</em> simplify it even further by writing:
</p>
<pre>
data.get(key, 0) += 1
</pre>
